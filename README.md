This is Landscape Evolution And Forecasting (LEAF) production tool implemented with Python programming language and Google Earth Engine (GEE) python API. With this tool, users can efficiently produce biophysical parameter maps with associated uncertainty estimates from the surface reflectance satellite imagery hosted in GEE. The two major features of this tool are: (1) various production requirements can be achieved by configuring a flexible input parameter dictionary; (2) all results can be automatically exported to a specified location (either Google Drive or Google Cloud Storage) in a batch mode. 

The regular output spatial unit of this tool is a 900km x 900km tile, which is defined by the Canadian geospatial tile griding system (there are 26 tiles covering the Canadian landmass). However, a customized polygon can also be utilized to define the spatial area of a production. Currently, four types of biophysical products (LAI, fCOVER, fAPAR and Albedo) can be generated with this tool. Next figure shows the flowchart of LEAF production tool.
